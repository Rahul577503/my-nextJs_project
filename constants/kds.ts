      content: `KDS Max Fax academy has been started with a vision of “Skill development” and “Clinical Learning” and mission is to learn more by doing. Number of participants in each batch has been kept to a minimum so that they are able to do procedures/ surgeries confidently by the end of the program, on their own. Another aim of small sized batches is that faculty can pay attention to each participant individually. Courses have been designed for beginners to develop surgical skills and competency and young surgeons to refine their skills.

Clinical support by the faculty will not be limited for only during the period of course but will be continued for an extended period of time for the participants.
